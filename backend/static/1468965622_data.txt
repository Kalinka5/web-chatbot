They are designed with the following features to reduce environmental impact: Arsenic-free display glass Mercury-free LED-backlit display Brominated flame retardant–free PVC-free Beryllium-free Highly recyclable aluminum Apple and the Environment Read our  Product Environmental Reports  for detailed information on the environmental performance of every Apple product. * To identify your iPhone model number, see  support.apple.com/kb/HT3939 . For details on LTE support, contact your carrier and see  apple.com/iphone/LTE . Cellular technology support is based on iPhone model number and configuration for either CDMA or GSM networks. Available space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 11GB to 14GB of space (including iOS and preinstalled apps) depending on the model and settings. Preinstalled apps use about 4GB, and you can delete these apps and restore them. Storage capacity subject to change based on software version and may vary by device. Size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process. iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP67 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 1 meter up to 30 minutes). Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty. FaceTime calling requires a FaceTime-enabled device for the caller and recipient and a Wi-Fi connection. Availability over a cellular network depends on carrier policies; data charges may apply. Data plan required. LTE Advanced, LTE, VoLTE, and Wi-Fi calling are available in select markets and through select carriers. Speeds are based on theoretical throughput and vary based on site conditions and carrier. For details on LTE support, contact your carrier and see  apple.com/iphone/LTE . Standard Dynamic Range video content only. Siri may not be available in all languages or in all areas, and features may vary by area. Internet access required. Cellular data charges may apply. All battery claims depend on network configuration and many other factors; actual results will vary. Battery has limited recharge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced by Apple service provider. Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings. See  apple.com/batteries  and  apple.com/iphone/battery.html  for more information. Testing conducted by Apple in August 2017 using preproduction iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus units and software and accessory Apple USB-C Power Adapters (18W Model A1720, 29W Model A1540, 30W Model A1882, 61W Model A1718, 87W Model A1719). Fast-charge testing conducted with drained iPhone units. Charge time varies with environmental factors; actual results will vary. Qi wireless chargers sold separately. Wireless broadband recommended; fees may apply. Some features may not be available for all countries or all areas.  View complete list .
